# Interview Scheduler

## Project Overview

Interview Scheduler is a single page application built using the React framework. A user is able to book an interview appointment from Monday - Friday between 12pm - 4pm. The user can then type their name and select an interviewer from a list of interviewers. This data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database. Meanwhile, the client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format. The project was tested extensively using Storybook, Jest, and Cypress.
